I'll believe when the walls
stop turning
I'll believe when the storm
is through
I believe I heard them say
David won't you stop writing songs
I never wanna shake
their hands and stay
I never wanna shake
their hands and stay
Oh no let's go
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
We're on our
way way way we're on our
way way way we're on our
way somehow
Hold me close close close
we're losing
time time time we're losing
time time time I'm falling
to the ground
I'll believe when the sky is burning
I'll believe when I see the view
I believe that I hear them say
David won't stop dreaming now
And everybody
clap your hands and shout
And everybody
clap your hands and shout
Oh no they shout
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
we're on our
way way way we're on our
way way way we're on our
way somehow
Hold me close close close
we're losing
time time time we're losing
time time time I'm falling
to the ground
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
we're on our
way way way we're on our
way way way we're on our way
Hold me close we're losing time
Hold me close we're falling
to the ground
Taxi driver
Sun is rising
Damn the sirens
Keep on driving
Flashing light
Oh what a night
I miss her bed
I lost my head
And it's sunning
We're still running
For her rooftop
Our last stop
Barefoot, naked
don't you let me go
To your place place place
we're on our
way way way we're on our
way way way we're on our
way somehow
Hold me close close close
we're losing
time time time we're losing
time time time I'm falling
to the ground
We are young
We are one
Let us shine for what it's worth
To your place place place
we're on our
way way way we're on our
way way way we're on our way
(This night will never end)
Hold me close we're losing time
Hold me close we're falling to
the ground
